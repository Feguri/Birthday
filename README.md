# Birthday
Simulates a room with people with different birthdays and works with their birthday matches.

However, I do find it to have one bug: when the number of people in the room of the simulation gets too large, birthday matches happens with several people,
but it is only programmed to look for pairs.

For example:

There are three matches :
person 1 - April 9
person 266 - April 9
person 346 - April 9

the computer will consider person 1 and person 266 as a match, but it will leave person 346 as it had no matches at all.

I think can fix this bug, but I'd like to leave the challenge for a few other problem solvers that are eager to fix things ;) 
I also want to get a taste of working on issues with other fellow programmers.
